# Med-Clinic

School project that uses MEAN stack.  
NodeJS and express for backend.  
MongoDB for database  
Angular for frontend.  
  
Note: design for frontend is simple as it can be with help of bootstrap (this means that this project is not oriented towards css and design of application)

## Run the project  

Ensure that MongoDB is running with correct database (name of database is now set to be __medical-clinic__)  

First install needed packages and start server inside backend folder use  
```
npm install;
npm run serve;
```

To install needed packages and start frontend app inside frontend folder use  
```
npm install;
ng serve;
```

If everything is properly setup app should be running at http://localhost:4200/
